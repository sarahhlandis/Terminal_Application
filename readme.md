## Application Features
1. Use of various user input throughout the program
- The app will require user input at various point throughout the app both in terms of navigating thru the application as well as responding to application prompts. 
- Upon opening the application, the user will be required to input which mode they wish to enter: Translation or Learning mode.
- Based on this choice, the application will then enter the chosen mode.
- The translation section will simply allow the user to input their desired text, select which language they wish to translate to, and then translate appropriately.

2. Learning Mode
- The learning mode will allow the user to learn specific words from their relevant course learning files (CSV).
- The user will have the opportunity to practice the words in a sort of flashcard style way, where a word will be displayed and the user will have to enter the translation. The user will be alotted 3 tries to correctly guess the word.
- Upon exiting this mode, the application will output the user's progress, in terms of a percentage (%) of words completed (gone through). It will also display which words the user needs to work on in terms of displaying incorrectly guessed words.

3. Quiz Mode
- The Quiz mode can be accessed at any time from within the Learning mode.
- Quiz mode offers the user the chance to practice the words they've learned with a time component.
- The user can select how long they wish to play for in terms of time.
- This mode will randomly generate a word that the user has encountered in learning mode, and require them to correctly translate.
- Upon finishing the quiz, the application will output their score in percentage(%) of correcly answered words.
